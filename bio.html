                &Tab;I was born in Livingston, New Jersey, only a short train ride to New York City.
                I have two brothers, one three years older and one two years older.
                I attended public school in Livingston until 8th grade when I moved to Morristown, New Jersey and transferred into the Morristown-Beard School.
                Throughout high school I was in a scout troop & venture crew, and ran cross country, swam, and threw javelin & discus.
                In true Tufts student fashon, I applied early to Brown & ended up going to Tufts.

                I am currently a Computer Science Major in the School of Engineering at Tufts (BSCS) and am planning to minor in both Economics & Computer Brain Sciences.
                My passions are making existing devices work with my Amazon Echo, playing video games (currently League of Legends, Zelda BOTW, and Splatoon 2), tea, and anime.
