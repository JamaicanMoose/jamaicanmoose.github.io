Everything in this project has been correctly implemented except:  
    - social icons are jpg rather than png (with alpha) leading to the offwhite background 
    not being transferred.  
No assistance was utilized in the completion of this project.  
Approximately 20 hours were spent on this project. (most of it just messing with CSS to get things to look good)
